# meLikee
meLikee is a parody dating app. It plays random audio pick-up lines from a Cloudkit database from premade profiles.
It is currently in beta-testing, so if you'd like to try it, email me! nazarioricardo@gmail.com.

## Why?
Because it's healthy to step back and laugh sometimes!

## But really, why?
I decided to make meLikee as a challenge to myself to code some features that I didn't know how to code. I was able to
design a database and learned how to download audio and image files from a server and present them cleanly and reliable
in the app.

## What kind of code can I find here?
If you're looking to gain insight on how to manage database information using structs with Objective-C try checking out the
code in the models folder of the Xcode workspace.

I developed a query that finds the number of records in a record type, something for which Cloudkit's API doesn't have a method.

Other than that it is all pretty standard!
